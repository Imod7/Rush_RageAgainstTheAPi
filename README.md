# Description
"Rage Against the Api" is a rush project at Codam College in which we were asked to create an application that finds the most efficient route from start to end point using RATP metro lines. We were suggested to use the API at navitia.io to get all the necessary data that we needed to solve this path finding problem.

For more details, you can find the subject here : [subject.pdf](https://github.com/Imod7/Rush_RageAgainstTheAPi/blob/master/subject.pdf)

# Challenges
A Rush project at Codam means that we have roughly one weekend to complete it. In this limited amount of time we had to accomplish the following :
- Understand how the navitia API works
- Check and test all the API requests that can be useful in our application
- Brainstorm solutions and design an algorithm that shows the most efficient routes from the start until the end point chosen by the user
- Implement the algorithm in python language which we do not use regularly during our curriculum

# Prerequisites
If you would like to run the program on your computer, you will need Python installed as well as the python library "Requests".

# Usage
You can run the program by following the steps below :
- Clone the repository
- Move to the cloned repository in your terminal and give the following command :
```
$ python3 ratp.py [Departure Station] [Arrival Station]
```
